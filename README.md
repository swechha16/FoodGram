# FoodGram_MG1
Our Fall 2019 Computer Science 309 project at Iowa State University. 

We created an android application. 

Description: 
People are indecisive when it comes to food and everyone is always wondering when their friends are eating. If only there was another social media app dedicated just for food. Upload pictures of your food, look at pictures of your friend's food, write and read reviews and leave ratings for restaurants.  Search for new restaurants with specific price points and by types of food. 


Languages and Frameworks Used:
Android Studio, Springboot, MySql
